# GolfCommand

Welcome to **GolfCommand**, the world's most advanced text-based golfing simulator. This project is a blend of my passion for programming and graphic design, creatively tailored to run on the command-line interface, specifically optimized for Windows 10 Command Prompt. It's more than just a game; it's an exploratory journey into Python programming, where I experiment with creating a rich, responsive interface design and integrate ChatGPT as a game narrator and an aid in user-input interpretation.
